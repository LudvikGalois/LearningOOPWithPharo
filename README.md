# Learning Object-Oriented Programming with Pharo

[![Build status][badge]][travis]

This repository contains the sources of the book *Learning Object-Oriented Programming and Design with Pharo* by S.Â Ducasse.
It is a follow up of *Botincs: Learning programming with Squeak*. But its contents are far more advanced and fun :).

The book is automatically built and available at:
[https://ci.inria.fr/pharo-contribution/view/Books/job/LearningObjectOrientedProgramming/ws/build/book.pdf][https://ci.inria.fr/pharo-contribution/view/Books/job/LearningObjectOrientedProgramming/ws/build/book.pdf].

The result from the latest successful Travis build can be found [on Bintray (PDF)](https://bintray.com/squarebracketassociates/wip/download_file?file_path=learningoop-wip.pdf).

Since I'm not a native english speaker, I appreciate pull requests that help me to get the material in better form.
